  /// {Sound Type System}:
  /// we have the;

  /// {Type Inference}
  ///   dart can infer type with the var keyword
  /// 
  /// {dynamic and var}
  /// var isn't a type but a keyword to tell dart to assign a type to a data -> static run
  /// dynamic is a type which allow data to have multiple type -> runtype run

  /// {Sound Null safety}
  /// Variables can't contain  null unless indicated
  /// data can either be nullable or non-nullable

  /// {compiler}
  /// dart uses Just in Time and Ahead of Time compiler on mobile devices
  /// dart uses dart development compiler and dart to javascript for web
  /// 
  /// there is the development phase -> Just in time compilation and is not best for production phase
  /// there is the production phase -> there is need to compile in native machine code and here comes ahead of time compiler

  /// {dart packages}
  /// this the main component of the dart ecosystem
  /// a local package can depend on other pub packages
  /// package on pub.dev is a library package and the other is application package
  /// a package has library in them and library is the only part of the package accessible to everyone
